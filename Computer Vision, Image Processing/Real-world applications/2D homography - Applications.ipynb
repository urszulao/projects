You are asked to implement a solution for each one. As you already know the fundamentals of the homography computation, this notebook will not address any theoretical aspect, but only presents the applications and asks for your solutions!\n","\n","### Some notes on the implementation\n","- If you use the command `%matplotlib notebook`, you'll be able to get the coordinates on the image at the mouse position. Use this **in each cell** when you need to select points on the images. Unfortunately this doesn't work in all jupyter frameworks (not in Google Colab, for instance). If it does not work, you'll have to get the point coordinates by opening the image with a typical image processing application (such as Irfanview, GIMP, etc.).\n","- Take into account that when you are computing a homography you are mapping image coordinates to *real world* coordinates (those in the real, unwarped plane), so if the latter **are too small** you will end up with a very small unwarped image. This will make more difficult to get references in such a small image. In some way, you are *losing resolution*. So, when creating the coordinates of the unwarped planes, use a value (factor) to multiply the real coordinates so that you get an image large enough to pick up points properly."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"rDY-IyWtqyOu","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687381751388,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":15665,"user":{"displayName":"aa aa","userId":"07113411070203193765"}},"outputId":"011e47aa-b3d5-4766-fc5e-98a6eb8de13d"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /gdrive\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/gdrive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"kgHPYGm_qvhr","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687381752034,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":649,"user":{"displayName":"aa aa","userId":"07113411070203193765"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import cv2\n","import matplotlib\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","matplotlib.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (12.0, 6.0)\n","\n","# set image path\n","images_path = '/gdrive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Chapter 11.
